        "One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. \"What's happened to me?\" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops",
        "A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath",
        "Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the " +
        "Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word \"and\" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.",
        "The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental.

        "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the " +
        "charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer " +

        "Since ancient civilizations, humans have been fascinated by the passage of time. The Egyptians used sundials to track the hours of the day, while the Babylonians divided the day into 24 hours, each with 60 minutes, influenced by their base-60 numeric system. Over time, innovations emerged — water clocks, candle clocks, and mechanical devices that used gears and escapements. In 1656, Christiaan Huygens invented the first pendulum clock, significantly improving accuracy. Later, quartz oscillators and atomic clocks redefined precision. Today, GPS satellites rely on atomic time to synchronize global navigation. Timekeeping has evolved from observing the sun’s shadow to measuring atomic vibrations in cesium atoms. It’s a testament to humanity’s desire for order, coordination, and curiosity about the universe.",
        "Space — an infinite expanse, cold, silent, and mysterious. Since the first telescope, our gaze has stretched far beyond Earth’s skies. Galileo’s discovery of Jupiter’s moons, Hubble’s glimpses of distant galaxies, and the James Webb Space Telescope’s insights into the early universe have deepened our understanding of reality. Black holes, neutron stars, exoplanets, dark matter — these aren’t science fiction anymore. They are puzzles being actively unraveled by scientists around the world. The cosmos stretches over 93 billion light-years and is expanding faster than we can fully comprehend. As Carl Sagan once said, “We are made of star stuff.” The very elements in our bodies were forged in ancient stars. Exploring space is, in many ways, a journey to understand ourselves.",
        "Nature doesn’t rush, yet everything is accomplished. Seasons shift seamlessly from one to the next. Birds migrate thousands of miles, forests breathe in carbon dioxide and exhale life-sustaining oxygen, and bees perform intricate dances to communicate food locations. Every leaf that falls, every wave that crashes against the shore, follows a rhythm deeply embedded in Earth’s DNA. Humans, too, are part of this cycle — our circadian rhythms, instincts, and behaviors influenced by the rising and setting sun. As we reconnect with nature, we rediscover balance. Whether walking through a forest, sitting beside a stream, or simply observing the clouds, we tune back into a rhythm older than any civilization.",
        "From the wheel to the microchip, human innovation has transformed the world. Early tools carved from stone gave way to machines that automate production, algorithms that learn from data, and digital assistants that respond to voice commands. The 20th century saw more technological advancement than any era before it: the internet, personal computing, and smartphones reshaped how we live, work, and connect. Now, with artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and virtual reality, we’re entering a new frontier. Technology has shrunk the world, putting knowledge at our fingertips and connecting people across continents in milliseconds. It’s both a tool and a mirror — reflecting our potential and our responsibility to use it wisely.",
        "The human brain is a 3-pound marvel capable of complex thought, creativity, memory, and emotion. It controls every heartbeat, every breath, and every decision — conscious or unconscious. With billions of neurons firing signals at lightning speed, it’s more powerful than the fastest supercomputers. It dreams, it learns, it imagines. Yet, we understand only a fraction of how it works. Psychology, neuroscience, and medicine continue to uncover its mysteries. Practices like meditation, journaling, and mindfulness enhance mental clarity and emotional resilience. The brain is plastic, meaning it can change and adapt through experience — a concept known as neuroplasticity. Our minds shape our reality, and what we feed them — ideas, thoughts, experiences — ultimately defines who we become.",
        "Every great discovery begins with a question. What lies beyond that mountain? What’s under the sea? How do stars form? From Magellan’s voyage around the globe to Curiosity’s exploration of Mars, humans have always pushed boundaries. Discovery isn’t just physical — it’s scientific, philosophical, emotional. Every theory challenged, every worldview expanded, begins with curiosity. Libraries, laboratories, art studios, and even quiet moments of introspection are all spaces for exploration. In an age of instant answers, it's easy to forget the value of the question itself. To explore is to be human — to not only seek new lands but new ways of thinking. The journey changes us, every time."
